# No Enchantment Conflicts
This mod removes the conflicts between:
- Infinity and Mending
- Protection, Projectile Protection, Fire Protection and Blast Protection
- Sharpness, Smite and Bane of Arthropods

This is a server-side only mod (works with unmodded clients!) 

***Note:*** *Although this is a server-side mod, it can still be used in single player on clients*
